# README | Final Project
### Due: Sunday December 18 at 4:00 PM

As part of your submission, complete the responses below. Be sure to include your declaration of the Honor Code at the end of this file.

1. Names of anyone with whom you discussed the final project with:

William (Lab Helper)
Josh Dawson
Thursday 12/17  7-9pm (lab helper)

2. What did you learn during the process of creating your final project?

even if it may seem obvious that self.bet() and self.bet are different, the computer gets confused if we use the same name for a method and an instance variable. 

while reversed(list) returns a copy of a reversed list
list.reverse() modifies the original list and does not return anything 
(same with sort() and sorted())

3. What is one thing you wish you could have done differently?

I wish player 1 and player 2 could take turns on who starts betting first. 

4. Honor Code Declaration:
I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment
